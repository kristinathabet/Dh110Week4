## Introductory Steps

### Step 1: Specify the main design challenge
#### What is the main activity your project would support the users in accomplishing?
This project will support users in being able to properly take care of their house plants and correctly identify plant species around them. It will also will help users keep themselves and their pets away from toxic plant species.
#### What is the basic need involved for that activity?
This activity fulfills the users safety and esteem needs. If users have a way to check which plants are toxic to humans and/or animals, they can better protect themselves and those they love around them. This activity also fulfills the users basic need for self esteem because being able to properly take care of house plants makes users fell confident, attentive, and sucessful. 
#### What is/are the traditional/current solution(s) to satisfy the needs?
Many toxic plants when hiking or sight seeing are labeled as toxic for percaution already. There are many ways to google the names of house plants and read up on care instructions and toxicity, yet this is a time consuming task that can pose bias information. There are many plant books that also go in depth about plant species and their characteristics. There are a few other plant identifying apps, yet they seem to be generally uncommon amongst my target demographic.  
#### What is/are the limitation(s) that possibly would be improved with (digital) technology?
Certain limitations to plant identification and plant care are finding articles and blogs with conflicting information about watering schedules and misidentifying a plant when comparing it to images on google. Added functionality to the PictureThis app could help users accurately identify the plants around them as well have access to the best watering patterns, sunlight levels, and potting a plant needs. Advanced functionality of this app would ease users stress of identifying plants on thier own. 

### Step 2: Identify target users
#### What are the characteristics of users? (ex. demographics, preference, expertise, mainstream vs. extreme) 
Demographic: Plant lovers, home owners, pet owners, nature gurus, adventurers

Preferences: Users own a lot of house plants, go hiking a lot, or have many plant allergies, and hence want to have easy access to plant identification tools and plant information. 

Expertise: Users do not need any particular level of expertise to use this application

#### In which context (where, why) would the users do that activity? 
The PictureThis app is used as both a plant identification tool and plant description dictionary. Users either take a photo of a plant directly through the app or upload one from thier camera roll, and the app will automatically supply users with ample information about the plants biology, toxicity, and care needs. Users can be found doing this activity in plant stores beofre they buy one, on hikes, or in their own houses. Not only can this app help users properly take care of their plants, but it's a great way to learn about other species of plants and stay informed about the vegetation around us. 
#### What do/did the users usually do in order to complete that activity? 
To identify plants before, users would usually google physical characterisitics of the plant and try and find a species photo that matches the one they are studying. Users also used books, blogs, and other plant lovers opinions to craft their own opinions about plants. 
### Step 3: Pick observation method(s)
The two observation methods I employed are ethnographic research and participatory observation. 
My ethnographic research consists of monitoring how my apartmentmates take care of their plants and decide to buy new plants for themselves. We are just getting settled into a new apartment so my roomates are buying new plants constantly as house decor, making them a perfect group to study. Some of my observations include:
I am conductiong this participatory research with a friend who fits my target demographic and has plenty of house plants herself.
